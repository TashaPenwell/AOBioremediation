<h1>The Science</h1>

<p>We work closely with each of our clients to deliver a site-specific solution to restore contaminated environments and provide long-term solutions to managing contamination.  Our process is cost effective, "green" and faster than most traditional remediation.</p>


<!-- the Process -->
<a name = "process"></a>
<h1>The Process</h1>
<ul>
<li>Is the natural and successful solution to most of today's polluted waste sites and environmental hazards </li>
<li>Often works on all contaminants of concern with a single application – no continuous on-site staff or equipment required </li>
<li>Uses indigenous, naturally-occurring microbes found in the environment to create an ecosystem that </li>
<li>Rapidly restores hazardous sites back to a clean state</li>
<li>Harnesses naturally occurring biogeochemical processes – the power of Mother Nature </li>
<li>Destroys or immobilizes contaminants rather than transforming them into a new problem – creating long-term waste solutions with no side effects</li>
<li>Saves money by shortening clean up times (up to 1/3 of the time of traditional methods) and providing a solution with lower capital expenditures compared to other remediation technologies that rely on costly equipment, aeration systems and physical removal techniques </li>
<li>Non-hazardous to humans, animals and plant life. Microbes are shipped under US DOT category Class 60 - all natural agricultural food product - and as such require no special permits. Moreover, the Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health, the American Microbiological Society and the American Type Culture Collection have all validated that every microbe in in Alpha Omega’s consortia meet the criteria for Bio-Safety Level l, which implies the smallest risks to 
humans, animals and plants. Because we use only Bio-Safety Level I microbes, they are totally non-harmful to whatever 
they come into contact with Our technology is approved by USEPA, Environment Canada and regulatory agencies 
worldwide. </li>
</ul>


<!--If they don't understand.  Getting to the emotion of why this is a better alternative-->

<h1>If they don't understand, they won't do</h1>
<ul>
<li>Costs less</li>
<li>Minimal disturbance of the property so normal site activities can proceed unimpeded</li>
<li>Waste to be treated remains on site, eliminating dig and haul and reducing environmental liabilities Organic pollutants are converted into non-hazardous products - no need to landfill sludge or residue Minimal capital construction and infrastructure required to commence treatment </li>
<li>Handles complex contaminants</li>
<li>Shorter remediation time, usually 3 to 18 months, compared to pump and treat</li>
<li>Can be used to treat large areas of contamination, land or water</li>

</ul>
